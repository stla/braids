Description: Deals with the braid groups. Includes creation of some
    specific braids, group operations, free reduction, and Bronfman
    polynomials. Braid theory has applications in fluid mechanics and
    quantum physics. The code is adapted from the 'Haskell' library 'combinat', 
    and is based on Birman and Brendle (2005) <doi/10.48550/arXiv.math/0409205>.
